Introduction
<The following subsections of the Software Design Document (SDD) document should provide an overview of the entire SDD.>
Objective
<Identify the purpose of this SDD and its intended audience. In this subsection, describe the purpose of the SDD and specify the intended audience for the SDD>
Scope
<In this subsection:
 Identify the software product(s) to be produced by name
 Explain what the software product(s) will, and, if necessary, will not do
 Describe the application of the software being specified, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals  
 Be consistent with similar statements in higher-level specifications if they exist

This should be an executive-level summary.  Do not enumerate the whole requirements list here

Overall Description
<This section describes the principles and strategies to be used as guidelines when designing and implementing the system.>
General Overview
<Briefly introduce the system context and the basic design approach or organization. Provide a brief overview of the system and software architectures and the design goals. Include the high-level context diagram(s) for the system and subsystems provided in previous documents like SRS (e.g., general use case diagram, lower-level use case diagrams, activity diagrams), updated as necessary to reflect any changes that have been made based on more current information or understanding. If the high-level context diagram has been updated, identify the changes that were made and why>
Assumptions/Constraints/Risks
Assumptions
<Describe any assumptions or dependencies regarding the system, software and its use. These may concern such issues as: related software or hardware, operating systems, end-user characteristics, and possible and/or probable changes in functionality>

Constraints
<Describe any global limitations or constraints that have a significant impact on the design of the system’s hardware, software and/or communications, and describe the associated impact. Such constraints may be imposed by any of the following (the list is not exhaustive):
Hardware or software environment
End-user environment
Availability or volatility of resources
Standards compliance
Interoperability requirements
Interface/protocol requirements
Licensing requirements
Data repository and distribution requirements
Security requirements (or other such regulations)
Memory or other capacity limitations
Performance requirements

Other means of addressing quality goals
Other requirements described in the Requirements Document

Architectural Patterns
<Specify and briefly describe the chosen architectural patterns and the reasons why they were chosen>
Interaction Diagrams

Unified Analysis Class Diagram
Security Software Architecture
<Describe the software components and configuration supporting the security and privacy of the system. Specify the architecture for (1) authentication to validate user identity before allowing access to the system;(2) authorization of users to perform functional activity once logged into the system, (3) encryption protocol to support the business risks and the nature of information, and (4) logging and auditing design, if required.>

Detailed Design
User Interface Design
<Suppose that you design a Graphical User Interface (GUI)>

Database Design
Database Management System
<Specify what is the decision of Database Management System (DBMS) and give some description of the DBMS>
Database Diagram
<

Show the diagram of DB design
>
Database Detail Design
<
Give a detail design of each element in the DB diagram. For instance, in a Relational DBMS, give a detail design for each Table and their constraints, illustrated in below table (PK: Primary Key, FK: Foreign Key).

You may add indexing, trigger, view, etc.
Give the database script>
Non-Database Management System Files
<Provide the detailed description of all non-DBMS files if any and include a narrative description of the usage of each file that identifies if the file is used for input, output, or both, and if the file is a temporary file. Also provide an indication of which modules read and write the file and include file structures (refer to the data dictionary). As appropriate, the file structure information should include the following:
•Record structures, record keys or indexes, and data elements referenced within the records
•Record length (fixed or maximum variable length) and blocking factors
•Access method (e.g., index sequential, virtual sequential, random access, etc.)
•Estimate of the file size or volume of data within the file, including overhead resulting from file access methods
•Definition of the update frequency of the file (If the file is part of an online transaction-based system, provide the estimated number of transactions per unit of time, and the statistical mean, mode, and distribution of those transactions.)
•Backup and recovery specifications>

Design Considerations
<Describe issues which need to be addressed or resolved before attempting to devise a complete design solution. Remember that, you have to refactor your source code to strictly follow the final design>
Goals and Guidelines
<Describe any goals, guidelines, principles, or priorities which dominate or embody the design of the system and its software. 
Examples of such goals might be: an emphasis on speed versus memory use; or working, looking, or “feeling” like an existing product.
Guidelines include coding guidelines and conventions.
For each such goal or guideline, describe the reason for its desirability unless it is implicitly obvious. 
Describe any design policies and/or tactics that do not have sweeping architectural implications (meaning they would not significantly affect the overall organization of the system and its high-level structures), but which nonetheless affect the details of the interface and/or implementation of various aspects of the system (e.g., choice of which specific product to use)>
Architectural Strategies
<Describe any design decisions and/or strategies that affect the overall organization of the system and its higher-level structures. These strategies should provide insight into the key abstractions and mechanisms used in the system architecture. Describe the reasoning employed for each decision and/or strategy (possibly referring to previously stated design goals and principles) and how any design goals or priorities were balanced or traded-off. 
Examples of design decisions might concern (but are not limited to) things like the following:
•Use of a particular type of product (programming language, database, library, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product, etc.)
•Reuse of existing software components to implement various parts/features of the system
•Future plans for extending or enhancing the software
•User interface paradigms (or system input and output models)
•Hardware and/or software interface paradigms
•Error detection and recovery
•Memory management policies
•External databases and/or data storage management and persistence
•Distributed data or control over a network
•Generalized approaches to control
•Concurrency and synchronization
•Communication mechanisms
•Management of other resources

Design and Program Evaluation
<Evaluate your design and describe which levels of coupling and cohesion that your design is at. Give proofs for your assumptions. Explain if there is any special design or exceptions>
<You may show the previous design from which you made improvements to get better levels of coupling and cohesion. You should clarify how and why you did these improvements>
<Does your design follow the SOLID principles if there are new requirements/changing requirements in the future? Give proofs for your assumptions. Explain if there is any special design or exceptions>
<You may show the previous design from which you made improvements to get a better design, which follows SOLID principles in spite of additional requirements. You should clarify how and why you did these improvements>
